This is the full 2017 COCO object detection dataset (train and valid), which is a subset of the most recent 2020 COCO object detection dataset. 

COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset of many object types easily recognizable by a 4-year-old. The data is initially collected and published by Microsoft. The [original source of the data is here](https://cocodataset.org/) and the [paper introducing the COCO dataset is here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0312.pdf).
